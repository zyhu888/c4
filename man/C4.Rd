\title{C4: Covariate Connectivity Combined Clustering}
\usage{
C4(adj, sim = NULL, K = NULL, alphagrid = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1), epsilon = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{Adjacency matrix of the network (symmetric, non-negative, with zero diagonal).}

\item{sim}{Optional similarity matrix derived from covariates (symmetric, non-negative, with zero diagonal).
If not provided, the function sets \eqn{\alpha = 0} to perform standard spectral clustering
based solely on Adjacency matrix.}

\item{K}{Number of clusters, or a range of integers. If a range is given,
the eigengap heuristic is used to select the best \code{K}. Default is \code{2:(n-1)}.}

\item{alphagrid}{A numeric vector of candidate alpha values. Default is \code{seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)}. Ignored when \code{sim = NULL}.}

\item{epsilon}{A small positive constant added to avoid division by zero
when computing inverse distances with silhouette score. Default is \code{1e-6}. Ignored when \code{sim = NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{alpha}{The selected alpha value.}
\item{K}{The selected number of clusters.}
\item{cluster}{Cluster membership assignments for each node.}
}
\description{
Perform C4 clustering, an adaptive spectral clustering method that integrates
network connectivity with node covariates for unknown number of communities.
The algorithm searches over a sequence of tuning parameters (\eqn{\alpha}) to
balance adjacency and covariate similarity, and selects the best result based
on silhouette score.
}
\details{
The method forms a combination of adjacency and covariate similarity matrices:
\deqn{(1-\alpha)W + \alpha S,}
where \eqn{W} is the adjacency matrix and \eqn{S} is the covariate similarity.
For each \eqn{\alpha}, the normalized Laplacian is computed, eigen-decomposition
is performed, and k-means is applied on the spectral embedding. The clustering result
with the highest silhouette score is returned.

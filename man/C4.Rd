\usage{
C4(adj, sim = NULL, K = NULL, alphagrid = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{Adjacency matrix of the network (symmetric, non-negative, with zero diagonal).}

\item{sim}{Optional similarity matrix derived from covariates (symmetric, same dimension
as adjacency matrix). Negative values are allowed, but the function conducts sanity checks
to ensure validity. Non-negative similarity values are recommended.
If not provided, the function sets \eqn{\alpha = 0} to perform standard spectral clustering
based solely on Adjacency matrix.}

\item{K}{Number of clusters, or a range of integers. If a range is given,
the eigengap heuristic is used to select the best \code{K}. Default is \code{2:(n-1)}.}

\item{alphagrid}{A numeric vector of candidate alpha values. Default is \code{seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)}. Ignored when \code{sim = NULL}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{kmeans()}, such as
\code{nstart}, \code{iter.max}, or initialization settings.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"C4"} containing:
\item{alpha}{The selected alpha value.}
\item{K}{The selected number of clusters.}
\item{cluster}{Cluster membership assignments for each node.}
\item{alphalower}{Lower bound of the alpha search grid.}
\item{alphaupper}{Upper bound of the alpha search grid.}
}
\description{
Perform Covariate Connectivity Combined Clustering (C⁴), an adaptive spectral
clustering method that integrates network connectivity with node covariates
for unknown number of communities. The algorithm searches over a sequence of
tuning parameters (\eqn{\alpha}) to balance adjacency and covariate similarity,
and selects the best result based on silhouette score.
}
\details{
The method forms a combination of adjacency and covariate similarity matrices:
\deqn{(1-\alpha)W + \alpha S,}
where \eqn{W} is the adjacency matrix and \eqn{S} is the covariate similarity.
For each \eqn{\alpha}, the normalized Laplacian is computed, eigen-decomposition
is performed, number of clusters is determined by eigengap, and k-means is applied
on the spectral embedding. The clustering result with the highest silhouette score is returned.

# Compute similarity matrix from covariates (Euclidean → 1/distance)
D <- as.matrix(dist(X))
S <- 1 / D
diag(S) <- 0

# C4 clustering on both adj and sim
result_C4 <- C4(A, S, iter.max = 100, nstart = 10)

# spectrum clustering on adj only
